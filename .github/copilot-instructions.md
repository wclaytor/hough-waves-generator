# GitHub Copilot Instructions - Alpine.js Template & Role-Based Development

## 🎯 Project Context and Purpose

This repository provides a comprehensive template and methodology for creating modern Alpine.js standalone HTML applications using a professional role-based development approach. When users request standalone HTML applications, tools, utilities, or "single file" solutions, use Alpine.js with Tailwind CSS to create reactive applications that work without servers or build processes.

This approach is ideal for:
- Internal tools and data analyzers
- Converters and utilities
- Educational tools and prototypes
- Applications requiring easy distribution (email, USB, shared drives)
- "Just double-click to open" simplicity

## 🚀 When to Use Alpine.js Standalone

### ✅ USE Alpine.js Standalone When User Wants:
- Single HTML file that works offline
- Tool to share via email or file transfer
- No server or hosting required
- Internal company tool without IT deployment
- Data analyzer or converter
- Quick prototype or demo
- Educational tool for students
- Progressive web app foundation

### ❌ DON'T Use When User Needs:
- SEO optimization for public websites
- Large-scale application with complex routing
- Backend API integration with authentication
- Real-time collaboration features
- Native mobile app functionality
- Server-side rendering requirements

## 📋 Core Alpine.js Template

Always begin standalone applications with this proven structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>[App Name]</title>
    
    <!-- Alpine.js for reactivity -->
    <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
    
    <!-- Tailwind CSS for styling -->
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    
    <!-- Bootstrap Icons (recommended) -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.0/font/bootstrap-icons.css">
    
    <style>
        [x-cloak] { display: none !important; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div x-data="app()" x-cloak class="min-h-screen bg-gray-50 p-6">
        <!-- App content here -->
    </div>
    
    <script>
        function app() {
            return {
                // State and methods
            }
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## 🎨 Essential Alpine.js Patterns

### State Management Pattern
```javascript
function app() {
    return {
        // === STATE ===
        data: [],
        searchTerm: '',
        filter: 'all',
        loading: false,
        
        // === COMPUTED PROPERTIES ===
        get filteredData() {
            return this.data.filter(item => {
                const matchesSearch = item.name.toLowerCase()
                    .includes(this.searchTerm.toLowerCase());
                const matchesFilter = this.filter === 'all' || 
                    item.status === this.filter;
                return matchesSearch && matchesFilter;
            });
        },
        
        // === METHODS ===
        async loadData() {
            this.loading = true;
            // Process data
            this.loading = false;
        }
    }
}
```

### Modal Pattern (CRITICAL - Use Inline Styles)
```html
<!-- ALWAYS use this exact pattern for scrollable modals -->
<div x-show="showModal" 
     @click="showModal = false"
     class="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center p-8 z-50">
    <div @click.stop 
         class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl w-full max-w-4xl" 
         style="height: 80vh"> <!-- INLINE STYLE REQUIRED -->
        
        <!-- Fixed Header -->
        <div class="bg-white p-6 border-b rounded-t-lg">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Title</h3>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Scrollable Content -->
        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 overflow-y-scroll" 
             style="height: calc(80vh - 120px)"> <!-- INLINE STYLE REQUIRED -->
            <!-- Content -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### File Upload and Processing
```javascript
async handleFileUpload(event) {
    const files = Array.from(event.target.files);
    for (const file of files) {
        const text = await file.text();
        if (file.name.endsWith('.json')) {
            this.data = JSON.parse(text);
        } else if (file.name.endsWith('.csv')) {
            this.processCSV(text);
        }
    }
}
```

## ⚠️ Critical Alpine.js Rules

### ALWAYS Follow:
1. **Modal Heights**: Use inline styles for dimensions
2. **x-cloak**: Prevent flash of unstyled content
3. **Computed Properties**: Use getters for reactive derived data
4. **Event Handlers**: Use Alpine syntax (`@click`, not `onclick`)
5. **Scrollable Content**: Use `overflow-y-scroll` not `overflow-y-auto`

### Performance Guidelines:
- Use `x-show` for frequently toggled elements
- Use `x-if` only for rarely shown elements
- Always use `:key` in `x-for` loops
- Debounce search inputs (300ms recommended)
