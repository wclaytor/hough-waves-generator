## 🔬 Technical Implementation

### The Hough Transform Algorithm

The implementation uses the **true Hough Transform** where each point generates a sinusoidal curve in parameter space:

```javascript
computeHoughTransform(points) {
    const accumulator = new Map();
    const lines = [];
    
    // Determine binning sizes (with optional coarse binning)
    const thetaBinSize = this.useCoarseBinning ? this.thetaBinSize : 1;
    const rhoBinSize = this.useCoarseBinning ? this.rhoBinSize : 2;
    
    // For each point, vote for all possible lines through it
    points.forEach(point => {
        // Vary theta from -90° to +90° in steps of thetaStep
        for (let thetaDeg = -90; thetaDeg <= 90; thetaDeg += this.thetaStep) {
            const theta = thetaDeg * Math.PI / 180;
            
            // Calculate r = x·cos(θ) + y·sin(θ) (polar line equation)
            const rho = point.x * Math.cos(theta) + point.y * Math.sin(theta);
            
            // Quantize theta and rho for binning
            const thetaKey = Math.round(thetaDeg / thetaBinSize) * thetaBinSize;
            const rhoKey = Math.round(rho / rhoBinSize) * rhoBinSize;
            
            // Cast primary vote
            castVote(thetaKey, rhoKey, 1.0);
            
            // Optional: Vote blurring - spread vote to neighboring bins
            if (this.useBlurring) {
                // Gaussian-weighted votes to nearby bins
                // Helps similar lines accumulate votes
            }
        }
    });
    
    // Determine threshold (with optional dynamic scaling)
    const threshold = this.useDynamicThreshold 
        ? Math.max(5, Math.floor(points.length * this.thresholdMultiplier))
        : parseInt(this.threshold);
    
    // Find lines that exceed threshold
    accumulator.forEach((votes, key) => {
        if (votes >= threshold) {
            const [thetaKey, rhoKey] = key.split(',').map(Number);
            const theta = thetaKey * Math.PI / 180;
            const rho = rhoKey;
            lines.push({ theta, rho, strength: votes });
        }
    });
    
    return lines;
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Point Generation**: Generate points based on selected pattern (wave, spiral, circle, grid, random)
2. **Sinusoidal Voting**: Each point votes for ALL possible lines through it by varying θ from -90° to +90°
3. **Accumulation**: Votes accumulate in parameter space (θ, r) bins
4. **Threshold Detection**: Lines receiving ≥ threshold votes are selected
5. **Optimization**: Optional coarse binning, dynamic threshold, and vote blurring improve detection
6. **Rendering**: Draw lines with selected color mode and opacity

### Algorithm Evolution

**Phase 1: Initial Implementation**
- Used pair-wise point voting (incorrect)
- Generated interesting but not wave-like patterns

**Phase 2: Algorithm Correction** ✨
- Corrected to true Hough Transform
- Each point generates sinusoidal curve in parameter space
- Result: Beautiful, authentic wave patterns emerged

**Phase 3: Optimization Framework** 🎛️
- **Problem**: Threshold >12 produced no lines due to vote fragmentation
- **Solution**: Three optimization strategies:
  - Coarse Binning: Groups similar lines together
  - Dynamic Threshold: Auto-scales with point count
  - Vote Blurring: Spreads votes to neighboring bins
- **Result**: Full parameter space exploration enabled

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Basic Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. The app generates a Hough wave pattern automatically
3. Adjust controls to modify the pattern
4. Click "Generate New Pattern" to regenerate
5. Click "Randomize All" for instant variations
6. Click "Download PNG" to save the artwork

### Dark Mode
- Click the moon/sun icon in the header
- Preference is saved to localStorage
- Applies to the entire interface

### Pattern Customization
1. **Pattern Type**: Choose from wave, spiral, circle, grid, or random
2. **Points**: More points = more complex patterns (10-150)
3. **Threshold**: Higher values = fewer, stronger lines (5-50 votes)
4. **Resolution**: Theta sampling step size (0.5°-5°)
5. **Opacity**: Full range from ethereal (1%) to bold (100%)
6. **Color Mode**: Choose your preferred color scheme

### Advanced Optimization
1. **Enable Coarse Binning**: When threshold seems too high with no results
   - Adjust Theta Bin Size (1-10°): Larger = more vote accumulation
   - Adjust Rho Bin Size (2-20px): Larger = more forgiving detection
2. **Enable Dynamic Threshold**: For consistent results across different point counts
   - Adjust Multiplier (5-50%): Percentage of points used as threshold
3. **Enable Vote Blurring**: When lines appear fragmented
   - Adjust Blur Radius (1-5): Larger = more vote spreading

- All three optimizations can be used independently or in combination

## 🔍 Key Implementation Insights

### Vote Fragmentation Problem
With fine-grained binning (1° theta, 2px rho), votes scatter across thousands of bins. Even with 150 points generating ~27,000 total votes, most bins receive only 5-12 votes, making thresholds >12 produce no results.

### Solution: Three-Pronged Approach
1. **Coarse Binning**: Reduces total bins, concentrates votes
2. **Dynamic Threshold**: Scales with point count for consistency
3. **Vote Blurring**: Spreads votes to neighbors with Gaussian weighting

### Result
Users can now explore the full parameter space (threshold 5-50) with any combination of optimizations enabled, creating everything from ethereal waves to bold geometric art.
